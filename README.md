>
>While this simulator aims to provide useful estimates, it is not a substitute for official CPF statements or professional financial advice. Always refer to your official CPF account or consult a financial advisor for accurate and personalized financial planning.

## ðŸŒŸ Features
- Calculate CPF balances up to retirement age.
- Visualize account growth using charts and tables.
- Projection of Ordinary, Special, Medisave, and Retirement Accounts.
