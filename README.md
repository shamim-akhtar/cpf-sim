# CPF Simulator

A responsive web-based CPF Simulator designed to calculate projected CPF balances based on user inputs. Built using HTML, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Chart.js. 

## ðŸŒŸ Features
- Calculate CPF balances up to retirement age.
- Visualize account growth using charts and tables.
- Projection of Ordinary, Special, Medisave, and Retirement Accounts.
- Customizable inputs for salary, bonuses, contributions, and interest rates.

## ðŸ“– Assumptions
- **Bonuses** are credited in January of each year.
- The **additional 1% and extra 1% interest** provided by the government is not considered.
- **Interest** is calculated monthly but credited annually.
- **Medisave Account (MA) contributions** above the **Basic Healthcare Sum (BHS)** are handled based on age:
  - **Below 55:** Redirected to Special Account (SA). If SA exceeds **Full Retirement Sum (FRS)**, excess goes to Ordinary Account (OA).
  - **55 or Above:** Redirected to Retirement Account (RA). If RA exceeds **FRS**, excess goes to OA.
- **Special Account (SA)** contributions exceeding **FRS** are redirected to **OA** when age is below 55.

## ðŸ“‚ Technologies Used
- **HTML & CSS (Bootstrap 4):** For structure and styling.
- **JavaScript:** Simulation logic and dynamic rendering.
- **Chart.js:** For visual representation of account balances.
